        <li>1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 cups sifted cake flour</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cake pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. <br>
            Add 3/4 cup sugar gradually, beating until very stiff.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cream butter and 1 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric beater until light in color. <br>
            Add egg yolks, and beat until thick and fluffy. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt over batter; fold in. <br>
            Gently fold in egg whites. Pour batter into prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes. <br>
            Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
