        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch cake pan.
        </li>
        <li>h4>Step 2</h4>
            Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. <br>
            Add 3/4 cup sugar gradually, beating until very stiff.
        </li>
        <li>h4>Step 3</h4>
            Cream butter and 1 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric beater until light in color. <br>
            Add egg yolks, and beat until thick and fluffy. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt over batter; fold in. <br>
            Gently fold in egg whites. Pour batter into prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>h4>Step 4</h4>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes. <br>
            Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
